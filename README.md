# CANable USB CAN

> **This project is deprecated. Please see [CANable_STM32F072C8](https://github.com/karlyamashita/CANable_STM32F072C8) for an up to date project.**

~~USB to CAN bus interface source code for use with Protofusion.org CANable interface.
Check the wiki for more info https://github.com/karlyamashita/CANable_USB_CAN/wiki~~


~~This USB to CAN interface project is based off my original project that uses a ST STM32F4-Discovery kit.~~

~~Read the wiki for more information on the original project and the CAN-X CAN bus analyzer software at this link https://github.com/karlyamashita/USB_to_CAN/wiki~~


~~Note: The CANable has issues sending the correct CAN_BTR value to CAN-X. Though CAN-X doesn't show the correct value, you can still send a new value from CAN-X to the CANable. This should be the final firmware.~~
